# IW7 Dedicated Server Resources
This repository contains the IW7 Dedicated Server config files and scripts to easily start a server. [To setup a IW7 Dedicated Server, check out the official guide here.](https://docs.auroramod.dev/iw7-server-guide)

If you are looking to modify the server config to your liking:
1. Go to **iw7-mod** folder, and open the **server.cfg** *(if zombies, do server_zm.cfg)* in a text editor of your choice, like Notepad.
2. Scroll through the list of dvars, and change your values out. This includes hostname, password if you want, a rcon_password, the map rotation, and more!

If you are looking to modify the server starter .bat script:
1. Go to the .bat, right click, and click "Edit".
2. There, you can change your config name, port, or mod folder of choice.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to make a issue. Contributions are also welcome and appreciated!
